# Genetic-Algorithm-Path-Finding
Solve a maze by using an evolutionary algorithm built from scratch. Starting from a random walk, the solution is reached by selecting the chromosomes that get closer to the solution (or get there in the minimum amount of steps) and breeding them, mutating them to create the next population.
